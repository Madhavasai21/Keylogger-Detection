# Keylogger Detection System Using Python
🚀 A cybersecurity tool designed to detect and prevent malicious keylogging activities using Python, process monitoring, behavioral analysis, and machine learning.
Keyloggers silently record keystrokes to steal sensitive data (passwords, banking details, confidential information). This project provides a real-time defense mechanism against such threats with alerts, logs, and a user-friendly interface.
